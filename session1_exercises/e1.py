Write a function that prints the string "Hello, world!" to the console.
'''
def ex1() -> None:
    # Your code here
    pass
    
'''EXERCISE 1.2: 
Write a function that takes the name argument and prints the string "Hello, <name>!" to the console.
'''
def ex2(name) -> None:
    # Your code here
    pass


'''EXERCISE 1.3: 
Write a function that takes two arguments (a and b) and returns their sum.
'''
def ex3(a : int , b : int):
    # Your code here
    pass

'''EXERCISE 1.4: 
Write a function that returns a list [1,2,3,4].
'''
def ex4() -> list:
    # Your code here
    pass

'''EXERCISE 1.5:
Write a function that takes an argument (a) and checks if it's a non empty string.
'''
def ex5(a) -> bool:
    # Your code here
    pass
    
'''EXERCISE 1.6:
Write a function that takes an argument (n) and computes the Nth Fibonacci number.
n < 0 -> 0
n = 0 -> 1
n = 1 -> 1
n = 2 -> 2
'''
def ex6(n : int) -> int:
    # Your code here
    pass

'''EXERCISE 1.7:
Write a function that takes as an argument a list l and and appends the number n to it.
'''
def ex7(l : list, n : int) -> None:
    # Your code here
    pass

'''EXERCISE 1.8:
Write a function that takes as an argument a list l and returns the element in the middle of it.
If the list if empty, return None.
If there is an even number of elements, return the first one on the middle (e.g. 6 elements, return element 3).
'''
def ex8(l : list):
    # Your code here
    pass

'''EXERCISE 1.9:
Write a function that takes as an argument a list l and return a new list where for each value x in the original list, the corresponding element in the new one is x*3.
'''
def ex9(l : list):
    # Your code here
    pass

'''EXERCISE 1.10:
Write a function that takes as an argument a list l and return a new list where for each value x in the original list, the corresponding element in the new one is x*3, but only if the value is an integer, otherwise it's skipped.    
'''
def ex10(l : list) -> bool:
    # Your code here
    pass

'''EXERCISE 1.11:
Write a function that takes as an argument a list l and a function f and return a new list where for each value x in the original list, the corresponding element in the new one is f(x), but only if the value is an integer, otherwise it's skipped.
