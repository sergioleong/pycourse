E0 :: Create Virtual Environment

In this exercise we will create a virtual environment named "env"

1- Go to the Source code path 

2- Create the environment with:
$ python3 -m venv env

3- Activate the environment with:
$ . env/bin/activate

* After the environment is activated, we will see "(env)" at the right side of the console

4- Now we can check that the environment is working correctly checking the path for python/pip executables:
$ which python
$ which pip

5- Finally, we can deactivate the environment with
$ deactivate


**NOTE:
We are going to keep using this environment for the rest of the course, so keep it activated while doing the exercises
