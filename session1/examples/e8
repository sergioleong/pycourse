E8 :: JSON

Now that we know how to work with files, let's focus on one specific kind of files, JSON files.

For this, we are going to use the json module.

This module can be used with both files and strings.

First, when using files, we need to open a file in read or write mode as we did in the previous example.
Then, we can load the content from that file using the load function "json.load(file)", or write our data into it using the dump function "json.dump(data,file)".

In the case of strings, we can use the loads function "json.loads(json_string)" or dumps function "json.dumps(data)". Both functions are parallel to the load and dump functions and share the same extra parameters as those functions.


When reading JSON data, it will be converted automatically to a Python object. 
For example, if you have a JSON string like this:
    {"name": "John", "age": 30}
it till be conberted automatically into a dictionary in Python. While a JSON string like:
    [1,2,3]
will be converted to a list.
